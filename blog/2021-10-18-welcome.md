Hi 👋️ Metadev WTF team here!

We are so excited to announce that our official blog is finally launched 🎉️ and we welcome you to this blog!

This very post is basically just another _hello world_ post when you build a blog, but we just want to make it a little bit longer.

## This blog, but under the hood

This blog is powered by [Docusaurus by Facebook](https://docusaurus.io/), and deployed in [Netlify](https://netlify.com).

For those who do not know, Docusaurus is a tool designed to make it easy for teams to publish documentation websites without having to worry about the infrastructure and design details, and it is backed by Facebook. Docusaurus basically is a documentation tool, but fortunately they also made it possible to use Docusaurus as a blogging platform.

Netlify itself is a web hosting infrastructure and automation technology company based in San Francisco, and it has become our CTO's favorite deployment platform since ever. Long before Metadev WTF was founded.

We ♥️ open source, hence we make this blog's source code open and you can access in our [Github repository](https://github.com/MetadevWTF/blog) so you can take a look what is in it.

_Psst 🤫️ there is nothing much to see. We literally just run `$ npm init docusaurus@latest blog classic`, configuring the `docusaurus.config.js`, put our image logo, and add this blog post you are currently reading._

## How do we use this blog?

As much as we love open source, we also love to be an approachable company. And we believe that giving a contribution to developer & artist community is a key to become a friendlier company 🤝️ So, we will use this blog for two main things:

- Publishing company-related announcements
- Sharing our knowledge about Smart Contract, NFT, DAPP, and Web3 in general

Finally, we hope you will enjoy our (upcoming) contents, and do not be hesitate to ping us in our Twitter account at [@MetadevWTF](https://twitter.com/MetadevWTF).

See you again soon! 👋️
